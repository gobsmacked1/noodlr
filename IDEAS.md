# IDEAS / backlog

Parked tangents — one line each. Promote to the roadmap in AGENTS.md when picked up.

- **Map upscaling (4x, seam-free).** Generate the base map, then upscale to a large,
  high-detail battle map. Blocked: needs a dedicated super-resolution model (e.g.
  Real-ESRGAN). OpenRouter offers none today (verified 2026-07-25), and a local GPU
  upscaler / Python sidecar is off the table (no capable GPU; keep install one-step).
  Cleanest path once available: one whole-image 4x super-res call to a super-res endpoint
  (no client slicing needed); client-side overlap+blend tiling only as a fallback. A
  disabled "Upscale to 4x (coming soon)" checkbox is shown in the Map generator config as a
  placeholder. Revisit when OpenRouter (or an easy hosted endpoint) exposes upscaling.
- **Third-party lore importers (World Anvil / Dungeon Alchemist / etc.).** Deferred as low ROI:
  most of these either export to JSON/CSV — already covered by the generic structured import
  (rc5) — or produce maps/scenes (Dungeon Alchemist → images/UVTT), which is scene/map territory,
  not lore RAG. A bespoke API integration (e.g. World Anvil's API) is only worth it if a user
  actually asks and has a large existing world there. Until then, "export → drop the JSON/CSV in"
  is the supported path. World-scoped Journal ingest + a "dump current NPC state" button are the
  higher-value native additions to consider first.
